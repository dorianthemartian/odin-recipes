        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Sourdough bread is a naturally leavened bread with a tangy flavor, chewy texture, and crackly crust. It's made using a sourdough starter, which is a fermented mixture of flour and water that contains wild yeast and bacteria.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sourdough Starter</li>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Water</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine water, sourdough starter, salt and flour in bowl, and stirring to form a sticky dough ball.</li>
            <li>During the first two hours of the bulk fermentation, perform a series of stretches and folds, which will give the dough strength and elasticity.</li>
            <li>Shape the dough, let it rest, then shape it once more.</li>
            <li>Proof the dough in the fridge, ideally for 24 to 48 hours, though you can get away with a shorter proof.</li>
            <li>After the dough has proofed, turn it out onto a piece of parchment paper, score it; then transfer it to a preheated baking vessel.</li>
            <li>Transfer to a preheated Dutch oven. Bake covered at 450ºF for 30 minutes; uncover, lower the temperature to 400ºF, and bake for 15 minutes more.</li>
            <li>Remove from oven and let cool one hour before slicing.</li>
        </ol>
